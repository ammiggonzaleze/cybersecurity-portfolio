# 🛡️ TryHackMe — Notes

This section contains concise technical notes from my **TryHackMe** labs, focused on practical **cybersecurity** skills.

I document:
- Key concepts and attack/defense techniques
- Useful commands and tool usage
- Common mistakes, edge cases, and clarifications
- Insights worth retaining for future engagements

The goal is **understanding and skill reinforcement**, not solution dumping.
