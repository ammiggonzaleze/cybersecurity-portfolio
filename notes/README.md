# Cybersecurity Notes – Study Notes & Concept Summaries

## Overview
This section of my cybersecurity portfolio is dedicated **exclusively to study notes and conceptual summaries**. The PDFs published here reflect my personal understanding of key cybersecurity concepts learned through courses, readings, and guided practice.

Unlike other sections of this portfolio, this area focuses on **learning, comprehension, and knowledge reinforcement**, rather than formal documentation, hands-on implementations, or personal reflections.

The files in this directory include:
- 📄 **Study notes in PDF format**
- 🧠 Clear summaries of **core cybersecurity concepts**
- 🔐 Explanations of principles, frameworks, and best practices
