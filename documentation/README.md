# Cybersecurity Projects – Labs, Simulations & Hands-On Exercises

## Overview
This section of my cybersecurity portfolio is dedicated to **practical, hands-on cybersecurity work**. It includes labs, simulations, scripts, and technical exercises designed to apply theoretical knowledge in controlled and realistic environments.

Unlike the notes section, this area focuses on **execution, experimentation, and technical implementation**, rather than conceptual summaries or purely theoretical learning.

## Scope of This Section
The content in this directory may include:
- 🧪 **Hands-on labs** from platforms such as TryHackMe and similar environments
- 🖥️ Simulations of real-world **attack and defense scenarios**
- 📜 Scripts, commands, and technical exercises
- 🔍 Practical exploration of tools, techniques, and workflows
- 🛠️ Step-by-step implementations focused on skill development

These projects are intended to demonstrate applied knowledge, problem-solving ability, and technical progression.

## Relationship to Other Sections
To maintain clarity and structure, this portfolio is organized as follows:

- **/notes**  
  Study notes and summaries of key cybersecurity concepts

- **/documentation**  
  Reports, structured technical documentation, and formal write-ups

- **/projects**  
  Labs, simulations, scripts, and hands-on cybersecurity exercises *(this section)*

- **/reflections**  
  Personal reflections on challenges, lessons learned, and key takeaways

Each section serves a distinct purpose and highlights a different dimension of my professional growth in cybersecurity.
