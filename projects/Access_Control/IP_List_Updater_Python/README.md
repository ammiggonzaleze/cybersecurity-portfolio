# Algorithm for File Updates in Python - Access Control Project

## 📌 Overview

This repository contains a Python algorithm developed to manage and update a file containing authorized IP addresses for employees in a healthcare organization. The project demonstrates practical skills in file handling, list operations, and access control automation within a cybersecurity context.

## 🧩 Scenario Summary

As part of the company’s security team, the objective was to maintain an accurate allow list of IP addresses for employees accessing restricted content. Certain IP addresses must be revoked based on a removal list. The algorithm ensures only authorized personnel retain access, improving security and compliance for sensitive patient data.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Read the contents of a file containing authorized IP addresses.
- Convert the file data from a string to a list to manipulate individual IP addresses.
- Identify and remove IP addresses present in a separate removal list.
- Rewrite the updated list back into the original file.
- Demonstrate proper use of Python concepts such as file handling, loops, conditionals, and string/list methods.

## 📁 Included Files

- `Algorithm_for_file_updates_in_Python.pdf`: Detailed documentation of the project explaining each step of the Python algorithm.

## 🛡️ Skills Demonstrated

- File handling in Python using `with` statements and context management.
- List operations including iteration, conditional removal, and string conversion.
- Automation of access control updates to ensure compliance and security.
- Clear documentation and structured coding practices for professional cybersecurity projects.

## ✅ Outcome

The algorithm provides an efficient and reliable method to maintain and update an allow list of IP addresses, ensuring only authorized employees retain access to sensitive data. This project showcases the practical application of Python in real-world cybersecurity tasks.
