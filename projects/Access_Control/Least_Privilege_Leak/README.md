# Data Leak Analysis - Security Incident Report

## üìå Overview

This folder contains the results of an exercise focused on analyzing a data leak incident involving internal business documents at an educational technology company. The objective is to evaluate the root cause of the leak, review existing access controls, and provide practical recommendations to enhance information privacy and prevent similar incidents in the future.

## üß© Scenario Summary

An employee at an educational technology company inadvertently shared confidential internal business plans with an external business partner. These plans were later found leaked on social media. The incident was traced back to a sales meeting where the principle of least privilege was not observed, allowing inappropriate access to sensitive documents. An internal audit is underway to determine the extent of the access violation and how the company can strengthen its data privacy practices.

This event exposed gaps in the company's access management and data governance procedures, raising concerns about the handling of sensitive information collected from academic institutions, teachers, students, and parents.

## üéØ Objectives

The objectives of this exercise are to:

* Investigate and summarize the incident.
* Review current data access and sharing controls.
* Recommend technical and procedural improvements to reduce the risk of future data leaks.
* Justify how these recommendations align with best practices in information security and regulatory guidance.

## üìÅ Files Included

* `Data_leak_worksheet`: A structured report containing the following sections:
  - **Incident Summary**: Key details of how the data leak occurred.
  - **Control**:
    - Issues: Identified weaknesses in access control.
    - Review: Analysis of current control measures.
    - Recommendations: Steps to improve data handling.
    - Justification: Explanation of how proposed measures will enhance security.
  - **Security Plan Snapshot**: A brief overview of current privacy and security protocols.
  - **NIST SP 800-53: AC-6**: Reference to the applicable control‚ÄîLeast Privilege.

## üõ°Ô∏è Skills Demonstrated

* Analysis of organizational security controls and access policies.
* Application of the principle of least privilege to real-world scenarios.
* Alignment of internal controls with NIST cybersecurity standards.
* Documentation and reporting of privacy and data handling incidents.
* Development of actionable security recommendations.

## ‚úÖ Outcome

This exercise illustrates the importance of enforcing the principle of least privilege and controlling document sharing practices. The incident report and recommendations aim to bolster the company‚Äôs ability to prevent unauthorized access and leaks of sensitive information. Aligning with NIST SP 800-53 AC-6 strengthens the organization‚Äôs data protection posture and helps maintain the trust of its stakeholders in academic data management.
