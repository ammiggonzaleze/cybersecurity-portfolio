# Home Office Network Asset Classification - Risk and Sensitivity Assessment

## üìå Overview

This repository contains the results of a hands-on exercise focused on identifying and classifying **network-connected assets** in a home office environment. The primary goal of this activity is to support **asset management** as part of an effective cybersecurity strategy, particularly by determining which devices require extra protection based on their risk exposure and information sensitivity.

## üß© Scenario Summary

I run a small business from my home and must maintain a secure digital environment. In this scenario, I was tasked with **creating an inventory of network-connected devices** in my home office. Each asset was evaluated for critical characteristics including ownership, network access level, physical location, and sensitivity level. The inventory helps identify assets that store or transmit sensitive information and require stronger security controls.

Assets assessed include standard computing devices such as desktops and tablets, as well as peripherals and infrastructure components like printers, routers, and switches.

## üéØ Objectives

The objectives of this exercise are to:

- Create a comprehensive asset inventory for a home office network.
- Document key attributes for each asset: ownership, location, connectivity, and notes.
- Classify each asset based on its **information sensitivity** level.
- Highlight which devices represent **high-risk entry points** to the network.
- Reinforce cybersecurity awareness by recognizing asset vulnerabilities.

## üìÅ Files Included

- `Network_Asset_Inventory_Table.pdf`:  
  A formatted table listing each asset with its corresponding characteristics:
  - Asset name and type  
  - Network access pattern (occasional or continuous)  
  - Owner of the device  
  - Physical location (on-premises or both on/off-premises)  
  - Notes on usage and sensitivity  
  - Final sensitivity classification (e.g., *Confidential*, *Restricted*, *Internal-only*)

## üõ°Ô∏è Skills Demonstrated

- Asset discovery and classification within a home network.
- Risk-based thinking applied to real-world devices.
- Understanding of information sensitivity levels.
- Application of asset management principles as part of cybersecurity planning.
- Clear documentation for ongoing inventory and auditing.

## ‚úÖ Outcome

This project demonstrates my ability to identify, analyze, and classify digital assets within a home office environment. It emphasizes my understanding of the importance of asset inventories in identifying critical data points and potential attack vectors, helping ensure proactive protection of sensitive business and personal information.
