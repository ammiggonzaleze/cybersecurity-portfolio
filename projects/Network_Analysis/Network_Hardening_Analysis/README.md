# Network Hardening Analysis - Security Risk Assessment

## 📌 Overview

This folder contains the results of a network hardening analysis conducted after a major data breach at a social media organization. The goal of this exercise is to identify key vulnerabilities within the network infrastructure and recommend effective hardening practices to reduce the risk of future security incidents.

## 🧩 Scenario Summary

While working as a security analyst for a social media organization, I was tasked with assessing the network following a significant data breach that exposed personal information such as names and addresses. Upon inspection, I identified four critical vulnerabilities:

- Employees share passwords.
- The database administrator account uses a default password.
- Firewalls are not configured with inbound and outbound traffic rules.
- Multi-factor authentication (MFA) is not implemented.

If these vulnerabilities remain unaddressed, the organization is at high risk for future data breaches or cyberattacks. A security risk assessment was completed to analyze these issues and propose actionable network hardening strategies.

## 🎯 Objectives

The objectives of this exercise are to:

- Identify and document existing network vulnerabilities.
- Recommend practical tools and methods for hardening the network.
- Explain how each recommendation helps mitigate specific risks.
- Support the implementation of long-term security improvements.

## 📁 Files Included

- `Security_Risk_Assessment_Report.pdf`: A two-part document containing:

  - Identification of three key hardening practices:
    - Enforcing password policies.
    - Maintaining and configuring firewalls.
    - Implementing multi-factor authentication (MFA).

  - Explanation of how each recommendation addresses the specific vulnerabilities discovered during the assessment.

## 🛡️ Skills Demonstrated

- Vulnerability analysis and risk assessment.
- Development of a network hardening plan.
- Understanding of password security policies.
- Firewall rule configuration and maintenance.
- Implementation of multi-factor authentication (MFA).
- Security reporting and documentation.

## ✅ Outcome

This project demonstrates how to respond to a real-world data breach by identifying weaknesses and implementing foundational network security improvements. Through clear risk assessment and practical recommendations, this analysis supports long-term organizational resilience against cyber threats.
