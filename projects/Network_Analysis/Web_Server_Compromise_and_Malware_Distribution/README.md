# Security Incident Analysis - Web Server Compromise and Malware Distribution

## üìå Overview

This folder contains the results of an exercise focused on analyzing a **web server compromise** incident and a subsequent **malware distribution attack**. The purpose of this exercise is to demonstrate the ability to identify, document, and recommend security measures after a successful **brute-force attack** that allowed an attacker to compromise a web server and deliver malware to unsuspecting visitors.

## üß© Scenario Summary

As a security analyst for **yummyrecipesforme.com**, a cooking website, I investigated a security breach where a disgruntled former employee conducted a **brute-force attack** to gain unauthorized access to the admin panel. Once the attacker had access, they injected malicious **JavaScript** into the website, causing visitors to download a harmful executable that redirected them to a malicious replica site. Visitors reported that after downloading the file, their browsers slowed down, and the website redirected them to **greatrecipesforme.com**, which contained the malware.

The analysis began by capturing network traffic using **tcpdump** and examining DNS and HTTP requests related to the site‚Äôs traffic. After uncovering the malicious activity, I documented the event and recommended a security measure to mitigate future brute-force attacks.

## üéØ Objectives

The objectives of this exercise are to:

* Investigate and document the security incident caused by the brute-force attack and malware distribution.
* Analyze the **network traffic** captured during the incident to understand the protocols and actions involved.
* Provide recommendations on preventing future attacks of this nature, specifically focusing on brute-force protection and securing admin credentials.
* Report the findings and actions taken in a structured incident response format.

## üìÅ Files Included

1. `tcpdump_traffic_log.pdf`  
   - **Description**: Contains raw tcpdump data capturing network activity, including DNS resolution requests and HTTP traffic.  
   - **Purpose**: To provide a basis for analyzing network traffic and identifying anomalies or potential security threats.

2. `How_to_read_tcpdump_traffic_log.pdf`  
   - **Description**: A comprehensive guide explaining how to interpret tcpdump logs. It explains key log components like DNS queries and HTTP requests, and discusses how to spot potential security issues.  
   - **Purpose**: To teach how to analyze and interpret network traffic logs effectively, focusing on identifying abnormal or malicious behavior.

3. `Security_incident_report.pdf`  
   - **Description**: A detailed report documenting the analysis of a security incident identified from the tcpdump traffic logs. It includes an identification of network protocols involved, a sequence of events leading to the incident, and recommendations for remediation.  
   - **Purpose**: To provide a comprehensive report of a network security incident, including findings and suggested actions to prevent future occurrences.

## üõ°Ô∏è Skills Demonstrated

* Network traffic analysis using **tcpdump**.
* Identification of malicious redirections and compromised website behavior.
* Incident reporting using a standardized template.
* Understanding of brute-force attack methods and their prevention.
* Malware distribution analysis and identification through JavaScript injection.

## ‚úÖ Outcome

This exercise demonstrates the process of identifying, analyzing, and mitigating a **brute-force attack** and **malware distribution** incident. The analysis reinforces the importance of securing administrative access and traffic analysis to detect and prevent similar security breaches in real-world environments. The recommendations made aim to improve overall web security posture and prevent future compromise of critical systems.
