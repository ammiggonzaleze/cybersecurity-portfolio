# Commercial Bank Cybersecurity Risk Register - Evaluation and Prioritization

## üìå Overview

This repository contains the results of a practical exercise in evaluating cybersecurity risks within a **commercial banking environment**. The main objective of this activity is to support **risk management** by identifying potential vulnerabilities, estimating their likelihood and impact, and assigning a severity score to each risk. This prioritization enables focused mitigation efforts on the most critical threats.

## üß© Scenario Summary

I recently joined the cybersecurity team at a commercial bank. As part of an ongoing **operational risk assessment**, our team is creating a centralized **risk register** to capture, evaluate, and prioritize security threats affecting the bank's information systems, assets, and data.

The bank is located in a **coastal area with low crime rates**, employs **100 on-premise and 20 remote staff**, and serves over **2,200 customer accounts** (individual and commercial). The institution partners with **local businesses and a professional sports team**, adding complexity to its data ecosystem. Being a regulated financial entity, the bank must comply with **strict data security and liquidity requirements** imposed by federal authorities.

## üéØ Objectives

The primary goals of this risk evaluation exercise are to:

- Identify and assess potential cybersecurity risks across banking systems.
- Estimate and document each risk's **likelihood** and **potential impact**.
- Calculate a **risk severity score** and determine **priority levels**.
- Provide actionable insights for strengthening security controls.
- Ensure alignment with the **NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF)**.

## üìÅ Files Included

- `Risk_Register.pdf`:  
  A comprehensive table detailing identified risks, including:
  - Asset and associated threat  
  - Vulnerability description  
  - Likelihood and severity (scored from 1 to 3)  
  - Risk priority score (Likelihood √ó Severity)  
  - Explanatory notes for each risk scenario  
  - A sample **risk matrix** used to categorize and rank threats

## üîç Risk Scenarios Evaluated

| Asset                  | Risk                       | Priority |
|------------------------|----------------------------|----------|
| Funds                  | Business Email Compromise  | 9        |
| User Database          | Poor Encryption            | 9        |
| Financial Records      | Accidental/Public Exposure | 6        |
| Physical Safe          | Theft                      | 3        |
| Supply Chain           | Disruption (Natural Causes)| 2        |

Each risk was scored using a 1‚Äì3 scale for both **Likelihood** and **Severity**. The final **Risk Priority** was calculated using the formula:  
**Priority = Likelihood √ó Severity**

A sample matrix included in the document helps visualize how scores map to risk categories (Low, Moderate, Catastrophic).

## üõ°Ô∏è Skills Demonstrated

- Risk identification and assessment in a financial services context.
- Application of **qualitative scoring** techniques for prioritizing cybersecurity threats.
- Use of **threat modeling** and **impact analysis**.
- Clear documentation and reporting of findings in line with cybersecurity frameworks.
- Alignment of security strategy with regulatory compliance requirements.

## ‚úÖ Outcome

This project reflects my ability to conduct a structured risk evaluation aligned with real-world banking operations. It demonstrates a solid understanding of risk prioritization and proactive security planning, contributing to the bank's capacity to prevent incidents, protect customer data, and maintain regulatory compliance in a dynamic threat landscape.
