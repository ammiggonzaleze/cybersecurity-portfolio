# Sneaker App - PASTA Threat Modeling Exercise

## üìå Overview

This repository contains the results of a threat modeling exercise conducted for a sneaker enthusiast and collector platform preparing to launch a mobile application for buying and selling sneakers. The exercise employed the PASTA (Process for Attack Simulation and Threat Analysis) framework to systematically identify and analyze security requirements for the application.

## üß© Scenario Summary

As part of the company‚Äôs growing security team, the objective was to build a trustworthy and secure platform that optimizes buyer-seller interactions while protecting sensitive user and business data. The PASTA methodology guided the process through its seven stages, enabling identification of business and security objectives, technical scope, threat analysis, vulnerability assessment, attack modeling, and risk mitigation strategies.

## üéØ Objectives

- Define business and security objectives tailored to the sneaker marketplace.
- Establish the technical scope with emphasis on critical components such as PKI and encryption models.
- Decompose the application to understand data flows and system interactions.
- Analyze both internal and external threats relevant to the platform.
- Identify vulnerabilities in APIs, databases, and configurations.
- Model potential attack vectors using attack trees.
- Recommend security controls including MFA, strict API validation, PKI/TLS management, and continuous patching.

## üìÅ Included Files

- `PASTA_data_flow_diagram.pdf`: Diagram illustrating data flow within the application, including user search and inventory interactions.
- `PASTA_attack_tree.pdf`: Sample attack tree highlighting attack vectors such as SQL injection, session hijacking, and weak credentials.
- `PASTA_worksheet.pdf`: Comprehensive documentation of all seven PASTA stages applied to the sneaker app context, including detailed threat and risk analyses.

## üõ°Ô∏è Skills Demonstrated

- Practical application of the PASTA threat modeling framework.
- Deep analysis of security threats in mobile applications.
- Identification and mitigation of technical vulnerabilities.
- Risk-based design of security controls aligned with business goals.
- Clear documentation and communication of security findings and recommendations.

## ‚úÖ Outcome

This exercise provides a robust foundation for developing a secure mobile platform tailored to sneaker enthusiasts and collectors. Implementation of recommended controls such as multi-factor authentication, PKI/TLS configuration audits, and rigorous API validation will enhance the platform‚Äôs resilience against common and advanced threats, ensuring user trust and data protection.
